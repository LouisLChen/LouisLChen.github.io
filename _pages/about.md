Hi, welcome to my website! I'm an Assistant Professor of Operations Research at the Naval Postgraduate School. I obtained my PhD in Operations Research at MIT, advised by Professor David Simchi-Levi. My research work is in the area of Operations Management.  More specifically, I have been studying decision-making under uncertainty (both stochastic and adversarial) in operations areas like inventory, scheduling, and networks. My focus has been using data and/or distributional information to design informative (and tractable) optimization models.


Research Interests
------
(Data-Driven) Distributionally Robust Optimization, Stochastic Programming, Convex Optimization, (Discrete) Convex Analysis, Optimal Transport


Ongoing Project(s)
------
* Distributionally Robust Influence Maximization (w/ Chee Chin Lim, Will Ma, Karthik Natarajan, Divya Padmanabhan, David Simchi-Levi)
* Distributionally Robust Inventory Network (w/ Peter Yun Zhang)
