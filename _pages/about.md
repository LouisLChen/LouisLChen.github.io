Hi, welcome to my website! Starting December 2019 I will be joining the Naval Postgraduate School as Assistant Professor of Operations Research. In the interim, I am a visiting researcher at National University of Singapore. I obtained my PhD in Operations Research at MIT, advised by Professor David Simchi-Levi. My research work is in the area of Operations Management.  More specifically, I have been studying decision-making under uncertainty (both stochastic and adversarial) in operations areas like inventory, scheduling, and networks. My focus has been using data and/or distributional information to design informative (and tractable) optimization models.


Research Interests
------
(Data-Driven) Distributionally Robust Optimization, Stochastic Programming, Convex Optimization, (Discrete) Convex Analysis, Optimal Transport


Ongoing Project(s)
------
* Distributionally Robust Omni-channel Inventory Management (a collaboration with Alibaba's Hema, Hanzhang Qin, Zirun Zhang)
* Distributionally Robust Inventory Network (w/ Peter Yun Zhang)
