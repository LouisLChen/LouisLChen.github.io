Hi, welcome to my website! I'm an Assistant Professor of Operations Research at the Naval Postgraduate School. I obtained my PhD in Operations Research at MIT (2019), under the advising of Professor David Simchi-Levi. My research work is in (Distributionally/Adversarially) Robust Optimization.  More specifically, I study decision-making under uncertainty (both stochastic and adversarial) in areas like inventory, scheduling, networks, and statistics/ML. My focus has been on using data and/or distributional information to design informative, tractable, and robust optimization models.


Research Interests
------
(Data-Driven) (Distributionally) Robust Optimization, Stochastic Programming, (Online) Convex Optimization, (Discrete) Convex Analysis, Optimal Transport, Networks, Influence Maximization
