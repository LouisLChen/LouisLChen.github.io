Hi, welcome to my website! I'm a PhD student in Operations Research, and my advisor is Professor David Simchi-Levi. My research focus has been in the area of operations/revenue management. More specifically, I study the problem of optimal decision-making under uncertainty in areas like inventory, scheduling, and networks.
