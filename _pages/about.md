Hi, welcome to my website! I'm a PhD student in Operations Research, and my advisor is Professor David Simchi-Levi. **I will be on the academic job market 2018-2019**. My research work is in the area of operations/revenue management. More specifically, I have been studying the problem of optimal decision-making under uncertainty in operations areas like inventory, scheduling, and networks. My focus has been using data and/or distributional information to design informative (and tractable) optimization models.


Research Interests
------
(Data-Driven) Distributionally Robust Optimization, Stochastic Programming, Convex Optimization, (Discrete) Convex Analysis, Optimal Transport


Ongoing Project(s)
------
* Distributionally Robust Max-Flows (w/ Will Ma, James Orlin, David Simchi-Levi)
* Distributionally Robust Omni-channel Inventory Management (a collaboration with Alibaba's Hema, Hanzhang Qin, Zirun Zhang)
* Distributionally Robust Inventory Network (w/ Peter Yun Zhang)
