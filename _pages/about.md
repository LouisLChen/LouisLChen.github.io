Hi, welcome to my website! I'm an Assistant Professor of Operations Research at the Naval Postgraduate School. I obtained my PhD in Operations Research at MIT (2019), under the advising of Professor David Simchi-Levi. My research work is in (Distributionally) Robust Operations.  More specifically, I have been studying decision-making under uncertainty (both stochastic and adversarial) in operations areas like inventory, scheduling, and networks. My focus has been using data and/or distributional information to design informative (and tractable) optimization models.


Research Interests
------
(Data-Driven) (Distributionally) Robust Optimization, Stochastic Programming, (Online) Convex Optimization, (Discrete) Convex Analysis, Optimal Transport, Networks, Influence Maximization


Ongoing/(Under-Review) Project(s)
------
* Adversarial-Robust False Detection Rate Control
* Online Discrete Convex Optimization 
* Rockafellian Relaxation in Optimization under Uncertainty: Asymptotically Exact Formulations
