excerpt: 'Labeling errors in datasets are common, arising in a variety of contexts, such as human labeling and weak labeling. Although neural networks (NNs) can tolerate modest amounts of these errors, their performance degrades substantially once the label error rate exceeds a certain threshold. We propose the Rockafellian Relaxation Method (RRM) -- an architecture-independent, loss reweighting approach to enhance the capacity of neural network methods to accommodate noisy labeled data. More precisely, it functions as a wrapper, modifying any methodology's training loss - particularly, the supervised component. Experiments indicate RRM can provide an increase to accuracy across classification tasks in computer vision and natural language processing (sentiment analysis). This observed potential for increase holds irrespective of dataset size, noise generation (synthetic/human), data domain, and adversarial perturbation.'
